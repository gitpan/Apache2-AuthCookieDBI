Generic Auth/Reg Feature List

Must be installable and configurable by someone with only basic Perl and
Apache skills. E.g. only slightly more involved than setting up BasicAuth
and writing a simple CGI program.

Jacob>  This could be accomplished by making a little script to install
        the necessary CGI scripts and stuff.

Configuration features:
In global section of virtualhost:
	PerlModule Apache::AuthCookieDBI
	PerlSetVar AuthNamePath /

	# this login script must use another cookie to set the destination
	# and we probably need to hack authcookie to look at the cookie
	# too.  the action should be /LOGIN.  the alternative is to always
	# make the login scripts look at the cookie if they don't get it in
	# the hidden field, which is probably right.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameLoginScript /cgi-bin/ACD/login

	# don't know if this is worth implementing, need to re-authenticate
	# and regenerate the token with every hit (or maybe we can just trust
	# the previous one and just update the expire time and rebuild
	# the MD5 checksum; probably requires hacks to AuthCookie either way).
	PerlSetVar AuthNameCookieExpirePolicy [ renew | time-to-live ]

	# or we could do it on the server side by updating a last-visit
	# table with every hit (ouch).  if we don't have this we use the time
	# in the cookie'd info, if we do have this we use that ticket as a key
	# into this database to see when their last hit was.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_SessionTable tablename
	# do we need more stuff on the field names and blah blah?

	# this determines how long the cookie is good for (ie how long
	# after the MD5'd date in the cookie (or the last entry in the session
	# database if we use one) we still take it)
 	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_SessionLifetime [ forever | time-to-live ]
	# time-to-live is formatted as a time delta:
	# 01-00-00-00-00 - 1 day.
	# 00-01-00-00-00 - 1 hour.
	# 00-00-15-00-00 - 15 minute

	# this is probably set by AuthCookie somewhere.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameCookieName name-of-cookie

	# this is the key we use in the MD5'd checksum.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_SecretKey "long and random string contaning much entropy"
	# In AuthCookieDBI before version 2.0 you could or had to put the key in
	# a seperate file via AuthNameDBI_SecretKeyFile, but this is no longer available.

In <Directory> or <Location> sections (server config or .htaccess):
	AuthType Apache::AuthCookieDBI
	# set this to whatever, but the PerlSetVar's must match it.
	AuthName AuthName
	PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthCookieDBI->authenticate
	PerlAuthzHandler Apache::AuthCookieDBI->authorize
	Require [ valid-user, user username, group groupname ]

	# you must set this.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_DSN databasename

	# all these are optional.
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_User username # default undef
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_Password password # default undef
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_UsersTable tablename # default 'users'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_UserField fieldname # default 'user'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_PasswordField fieldname # default 'password'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_CryptType [ none, crypt, MD5 ] # default 'none'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_GroupsTable tablename # default 'groups'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_GroupField fieldname # default 'group'
	PerlSetVar AuthNameDBI_GroupUserField fieldname # default 'user'

	# dunno what this is.
	DefaultTarget  partial or full URL

You also need this to get people to log in (although I'm not exactly sure
why; I guess it's so that login() gets called, but why can't we check for
credentials and log them in at the same point that we redirect them off to
the login form?):

	<Location /LOGIN>
		AuthType Apache::AuthCookieDBI
		AuthName AuthName
		SetHandler perl-script
		PerlHandler Apache::AuthCookieDBI->login
	</Location>
